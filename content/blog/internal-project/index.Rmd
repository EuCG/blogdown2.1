How to create an internal blog post using blogdown from within a Hugo blog. Following J. Sloane and Tehilla O. video-tutorials the next chunk, from video 9 in the series, is to use R code within a blog post

```{r}
#install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggplot2)

#take a look at the data
head(penguins)

#scatter plotting 
ggplot(penguins, aes(bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm, color = species))+
  geom_point()


```
